# Longitudinal Platoon Simulation
These simulations represent a Comparision of Laguerre-based  MPC and Traditional MPC for the platoon of vehicles.

You can download casadi solver from https://github.com/casadi/casadi and change the path in line 67 m-files.

The below figure shows the time of solution by Laguerre-based  MPC and Traditional MPC for platoons with a different number of vehicles and prediction horizons. 
The simulation results have been performed on a system with Core i5 2.5 GHz and 8 GB of RAM.

The below animation shows the forming platoon from the initial states by applying Laugere-based MPC.
